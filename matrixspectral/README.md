These two sets of slides for Math 617 Functional Analysis will partially
make up for missed days, and back-fill finite-dimensional linear algebra.

* Finite-dimensional spectral theory I

* Finite-dimensional spectral theory II

    * functional calculus: f(A) by Taylor series
    * unitary <-> hermitian
    * singular value decomposition
    * SVD vs eigenvalues
    * SVD answers questions (invertibility, rank, nullity, conditioning)
    * low rank approximations
    * extension to infinite-dimensions
