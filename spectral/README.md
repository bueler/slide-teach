spectral/
=========

These two sets of slides, written for Math 617 Functional Analysis in Spring
2020, will partially make up for missed days.  The purpose is to back-fill
finite-dimensional linear algebra so that our trajectory toward the spectral
theorem, first for compact operators and then for bounded operators, is clear.

* Finite-dimensional spectral theory I

    * C^n as an inner product space
    * linear-independence, span, basis
    * matrices and adjoints
    * matrix multiplication
    * Gram-Schmidt process and QR
    * technique: extend to an ON basis
    * eigenvalues, eigenvectors, eigendecompositions
    * hermitian matrices
    * similarity, diagonalizability, defectiveness
    * Schur decomposition, with proof
    * normal matrices
    * spectral theorem for normal matrices

* Finite-dimensional spectral theory II

    * functional calculus: f(A) by Taylor series
    * mapping between hermitian and unitary
    * constructing orthonormal projections from ON vectors
    * spectrum subsets <--> projections
    * singular value decomposition
    * SVD vs eigenvalues
    * SVD answers questions (invertibility, rank, nullity, conditioning)
    * low rank approximations
    * extend to infinite-dim'ns: compact and bounded operators on Hilbert space
