spectral/
=========

These two sets of slides were written for Math 617 Functional Analysis in Spring
2020.  The purpose is to back-fill finite-dimensional linear algebra so that our
trajectory toward the spectral theorem, first for compact operators and then for
bounded operators, is clear.

* not covered yet:

    * commuting operators
    * polar form
    * SVD gives low rank approximations
