spectral/
=========

These two sets of slides, written for Math 617 Functional Analysis in Spring
2020, will partially make up for missed days.  The purpose is to back-fill
finite-dimensional linear algebra so that our trajectory toward the spectral
theorem, first for compact operators and then for bounded operators, is clear.


* Finite-dimensional spectral theory II

    * functional calculus: f(A) by Taylor series
    * mapping between hermitian and unitary and solving ODEs
    * resolvents
    * commuting operators
    * mention: holomorphic, continuous, and Borel functional calculi
    * constructing orthonormal projections from ON vectors
    * spectrum subsets <--> projections
    * singular value decomposition
    * SVD vs eigenvalues
    * polar form
    * SVD answers questions: invertibility, rank, nullity, conditioning
    * low rank approximations
    * extend to infinite-dim'ns: compact and bounded operators on Hilbert space
