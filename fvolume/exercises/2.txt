Consider the scalar advection equation  q_t + a q_x = 0  on [0,1] with periodic
boundary conditions and a = 1.  Recall that the basic FV derivation gives an
MOL equation
   dQ_i / dt + (F_{i+1/2} - F_{i-1/2}) / Delta x = 0
where F(q) = a q.

(a) Implement the upwind method this way, that is, as a donor-cell calculation of the cell-face fluxes F_{i+1/2} plus forward Euler.  (See the "upwind as the donor-cell method" slide.)  Choose a piecewise-linear but continuous initial condition.  Observe that the exact solution at an integer time is the same as the initial condition, and generate a figure.  Measure the numerical error in some suitable norm at t=1 and t=5.

(b) Now implement the minmod slope limiter.  See the "from reconstruction to flux" and "slope limiter idea" slides.  Apply this idea, which will give a slightly-modified formula for the face fluxes, compared to part (a).  Redo the results in part (a).

(c) Finally, keep the minmod slope limiter but generalize to the MOL form and apply a better ODE method.  Redo the results in part (a) and (b).
