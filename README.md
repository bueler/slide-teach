# slide-teach

This repo contains slides for specific, smallish topics which I use in
teaching classes, especially for classes with numerical, differential
equations, or linear algebra content.

These materials are all public.

Several topics were previously in my private [teaching](https://github.com/bueler/teaching)
repo.  Thus certain history (probably unimportant) is only recoverable there.
