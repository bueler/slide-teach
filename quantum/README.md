I plan to put slides for a Spring 2020 colloquium talk, perhaps titled _Quantum mechanics (for mathematicians)_, here.  The colloquium talk will also be an extra class for MATH 617 Functional Analysis.


_If there is anything in our present understanding of nature likely to survive in a final theory, it is quantum mechanics._ Steve Weinberg, _Dreams of a Final Theory_, Vintage Books 1994, page 66.
